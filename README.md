# ArangoMiGO.

A schema evolution tool for [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com/). Manage your collections, indices, 
and data transformations in a centralized way in your source control along with your application.

The goal behind the project is to apply to ArangoDB years of hard fought lessons (especially those 
that kicked us in the teeth). We needed a schema version manager that could create a database, add 
all of the collections, indexes and data population necessary for a developer to create a local VM 
of ArangoDB that looks like a mini-production. The system should automatically adjust to merges.
While providing all of this, it must also support the neat features we all know and chose ArangoDB for: 
sharding collections on distributed systems. This means that we can't rely on creating the collection 
automatically if it doesn't exist when inserting a document. Sometimes collections should come 
preloaded with some documents from start.


## Creating your structures

ArangoMiGO supports creating, modifying, and deleting graphs, collections, and even the database. 
Below you'll see how to use YAML to create a migration set. Once a migration component executes, 
the system doesn't rerun it. You don't have to worry about creating a collection or running data
migration twice.

### Creating your database
```yaml
type: database
action: create
name: MigoFull
allowed:
  - username: ${patricksUser}
    password: ${patricksPassword}

```
